# Getting Started on the Internet — Summer Nineteen-Ninety-Two
## This is a fictional tribute to the original 1992 "Zen and the Art of the Internet" by late Brendan P. Kehoe, reimagined for demonstration purposes.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

# Section One. Introduction.

Picture a loose web of university computers, research labs, and hobby machines, all linked by phone lines that hiss and click. Everything you see will be plain text. Almost everyone you meet will still be patient. This short talk walks you through a first session: logging in, finding information, asking a question, and logging out.

# Section Two. Making the first connection.

Place the telephone handset on the modem cradle and press “originate.”

Wait for the rising whistle that says the carriers have locked.

When the screen shows the word “login” followed by a colon, type the user name your system administrator gave you.

The prompt “Password” now appears; nothing you type will echo.

After you are accepted the computer prints a message of the day, then leaves you at a prompt—often a dollar sign or a percent sign. That little mark means the machine is listening.

# Section Three. Core services.

## Sub-section: Electronic Mail.

At the prompt, type the four letters “mail,” a space, and then the address of the person you want: for example, “pat at example dot E-D-U.”

Press Return.

On the next line type “Subject,” a colon, and a short description—under forty characters is kind.

Write your note.

To finish, press Return, type a single period on its own line, and press Return again.

Keep each line under seventy-two characters so older terminals do not wrap the text in odd places.

End with your name and institution; a plain signature builds trust.

## Sub-section: Mailing lists.

Every busy discussion soon moves to a list.

To join, send mail to the same list name, followed by the word “request.”

Spend your first week listening; each list has its own slang and speed.

When you leave, write the same “request” address. Never post the word “unsubscribe” to the entire list—people remember.


## Sub-section: Usenet news.

Start the news reader by typing the letters “R N” and pressing Return.

Before you read anything else, open the group called “news dot announce dot newusers.” The files there are a free insurance policy against public embarrassment.

When you reply, quote only the lines you need and avoid capital letters for entire words; on Usenet that is shouting.


## Sub-section: Telnet catalogues.

To reach the University of California card catalogue, type “telnet library dot berkeley dot E-D-U.”

Most catalogues print help as soon as you arrive.

Leave with the word “quit,” not by simply closing the connection; a clean exit spares the remote machine extra work.


## Sub-section: File transfer, usually called F-T-P.

Connect to “W U archive dot W U S T L dot E-D-U.”

Log in as the word “anonymous.”

When asked for a password, type your e-mail address; it is considered polite.

Switch to binary mode when you fetch software, and to ASCII mode when you fetch plain text.

If you can, download large files late at night; everyone shares the same backbone.


## Sub-section: Gopher.

Start Gopher by typing the word itself, a space, then “gopher dot T-C dot U-M-N dot E-D-U.”

Use the arrow keys to move, the letter “U” to go back up, and the letter “Q” to quit.

When you find a menu item you will want again, copy the selector string into a scratch file. Bookmarks save time.


## Sub-section: Finger and Whois.

Finger, spelled “F-I-N-G-E-R,” followed by a login name and an at-sign, shows when a user last logged in.

Whois, spelled “W-H-O-I-S,” followed by a surname, finds domain contacts on “whois dot internic dot net.”


# Section Four. Netiquette.

Write as though the recipient is beside you.

Read the relevant Frequently Asked Questions before posting.

Keep lines short, trim quoted text to the minimum that preserves context, and thank people in public when they help; goodwill travels farther than packets.


# Section Five. Fixing trouble.

To learn what a command expects, type “man,” a space, and the command name.

If a host refuses to answer, type “ping,” a space, and the host name.

“Unknown host” means you probably misspelled the name. “One hundred percent packet loss” means the network path is broken.

When you ask for help, include exactly what you typed and exactly what the computer replied. Vague reports only stretch the conversation.


# Section Six. Keeping notes.

Create a file called “net dash log dot T-X-T.” At the end of every session, jot down one command you learned, one resource you found, and one question that remains. Read the file each week; it will become your personal manual.


# Section Seven. Signing off.

Type “exit,” wait for the carrier to drop, replace the telephone handset, and stand up. Stretch, look outside, and decide what you will explore tomorrow. The Net will be bigger by then, but everything you practised today will still work.
